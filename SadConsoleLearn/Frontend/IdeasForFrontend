* Separate UI Components
Currently, GameScreen handles multiple roles—managing the game area, character info, and message log. 
Extracting each into its own dedicated class or component can help isolate concerns. 
For example, a dedicated MessageLog class could encapsulate all logic related to displaying and updating messages.

* Adopt a Layout Manager
Instead of hardcoding positions and dimensions (as seen in GameScreen and RootScreen), 
consider creating or adopting a layout manager that dynamically arranges UI elements. 
This would make the UI more responsive to changes in screen size and help maintain consistency across different game states.

* Screen and State Management
Right now, the RootScreen simply adds the GameLoop, 
and the GameLoop takes over most responsibilities. Implementing a dedicated screen or state manager 
can provide a more flexible way to transition between different screens (e.g., main menu, in-game, pause) 
and handle overlays or pop-ups in a structured manner.

* Decouple Input from UI
Although input is already handled separately in the InputHandler, 
consider ensuring that UI input (like interacting with panels) is managed by a separate layer or handler. 
This will help keep the game logic (e.g., movement and events) isolated from UI interaction details.

* Enhance Dependency Injection for UI
You’re already using DI for the backend in Program.cs. 
Extending this pattern to UI components will allow for more flexible swapping of UI elements, 
easier testing, and better decoupling between UI and game logic.

* Event Handling and UI Updates
Right now, UI elements like the message log subscribe directly to events in their constructors. 
Consider centralizing event subscriptions for UI elements so that all UI updates occur through a 
well-defined pipeline or manager. This can help avoid scattered subscriptions and simplify 
maintenance when event logic changes.
