ToDo

Fundamentals and Infrastructure
-[x] Set up a foundational ECS system that can: 
    -[x] Entity Manager - Add, Remove, GetById, GetAll.
        -[x] Interface to support in dependency injection
    -[x] Component Manager - Add, Remove, Get.
        -[x] Interface to support in dependency injection
    -[x] Event System - Subscribe, Unsubscribe, Publish. //OnetimeSub, Queue-events.
        -[x] Interface to support in dependency injection
    -[x] Entities, Components and Events to go with. 

I do believe we have this system up and running now. 
I will likely need to write some tests to make sure everything is working as expected.
but for now, I will move on to the next system.

Input, Movement and Rendering.

    -[x] InputSystem
        -[x] ProcessInput using SadConsole's KeyboardState.
        -[x] Publish events for movement.
    -[x] MovementSystem
        -[x] Subscribe to movement events.
        -[x] Process movement events. (Changing position of entities via componentManager)       
    -[] RenderSystem
        -() :FrontEnd: Make sure the screen setup is correct.
        -[x] Subscribe to render events.
        -[x] Process render events.
